I think I have a decently wide array of skills and am still learning new ones. I have taken classes in various topics and done somewhat well in the majority of those classes. I am able to pick up new skills rather quickly if there is a topic I am less knowledgeable on. I did not get much practice working with a team through this school but have at other schools and other areas of my life. We have reviewed talking to stakeholders, and I would say I have a decent ability to write for communicating needs.

This portfolio gives a look at what I can create mostly from the ground up. It shows off how I understand code with the code review and shows how I can upgrade something and utilize skills and tools that are new to me.
