# Self-Assessment

I think I have a decently wide array of skills and am still learning new ones. I have taken classes in various topics and done somewhat well in the majority of those classes. I am able to pick up new skills rather quickly if there is a topic I am less knowledgeable on. I did not get much practice working with a team through this school but have at other schools and other areas of my life. We have reviewed talking to stakeholders, and I would say I have a decent ability to write for communicating needs.

This portfolio gives a look at what I can create mostly from the ground up. It shows off how I understand code with the code review and shows how I can upgrade something and utilize skills and tools that are new to me.

### Code Review

### Project

[CS 320 Project 1 Nathan Redding.zip](https://github.com/nathanr90/nathanr90.github.io/blob/main/CS%20320%20Project%201%20Nathan%20Redding.zip)

I chose to remake a set of classes from CS 320 that stored lists of objects. The original project was only these class files and some automated test files, but I decided to turn these class files into something more usable for this final project. I felt giving these classes more of a purpose would be an appropriate amount of work for this project, especially because I would need to create a database for it, which is something I hadnâ€™t really done on my own yet. I think this shows the general quality of my work and my ability to learn new skills.

The biggest challenge I faced in this project was the creation and working with the database. The work with databases I had done prior had the databases made for me, so making one on my own was a bit daunting. However, as I went through the steps I felt I was more prepared than I originally thought and was able to make something I feel is adequate for the database enhancement required. I think this project mostly touches on the third, fourth, and fifth course outcomes, those being: design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices, demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals, and develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.  The trade-offs I encountered were that I moved away from the original thought of using the classes mostly unchanged to making them more appropriate for use with the database to simplify the design, I used a tool that was somewhat foreign to me to make the program, being the database, and I put several input validations within the program to mitigate design flaws. The last course outcome was probably the least touched on out of these three.
